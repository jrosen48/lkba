        <Text>We are embarrassed about how long it took us to discover this gem of a state park, which is only 30 minutes from Knoxville! Seven Islands State Birding Park, more commonly referred to as, simply, Seven Islands, is an ideal destination for families looking for family-friendly hiking, wildlife, water access via the French Broad River, views of Mt. LeConte and the Smokies, and even access to biking.
The trail we highlight is a particularly accessible yet also highlight-rich one. There are two primary trailheads at the state park, one near an open barn at the start of a long, paved path, and the other is on the French Broad River and is the place to start paddling on the river. 
A gem that is off the radar of many in Knoxville. Starts at a trailhead with trails heading in many directions. Walk up the paved path past botanical specimens--including unusual conifers! Circles around park facilities past a pretty field and forests. Upon returning to the start, there are other trails to the different ecological zones represented in an area that is worth a visit; we like the trails near the marshy area with the surprising, clear creek, perfect for splashing in warm weather. Suitable for kids of all ages.
