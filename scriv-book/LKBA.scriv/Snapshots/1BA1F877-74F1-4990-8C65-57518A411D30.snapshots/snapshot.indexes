        <Text>●	Visiting Townsend. Townsend rightly contrasts itself with busy Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg—it remains quiet but full of places to stop. We love the kid-friendly Peaceful Side Social (7967 E Lamar Alexander Pkwy, Townsend, TN 37882) and the next-door Peaceful Side Creamery. 
●	Swimming at the Townsend Wye. This is a classic summertime Smokies activity. From the large parking area near the trailhead, swim in the Little River beside the Townsend Wye—the three-way intersection of Townsend Entrance Road (toward Townsend), Laurel Creek Road (to Cades Cove), and Little River Gorge Road (toward Gatlinburg).</Text>
