        <Text>●	Stop by a fun food hall. The nearby Kern’s Food Hall (2201 Kerns Rising Way, Knoxville, TN 37920) has a good range of options — and an outdoor play area for kids to romp around. 
●	Hiking the nearby River Bluff Wildlife area. The nearby River Bluff Wildlife Area is an interesting counterbalance to the ease of High Ground Park - it features a short but rustic hike to a pretty overlook of the city. Visit Knoxville’s website (https://www.visitknoxville.com/) has more information and a nice map. </Text>
