        <Text>This is a hike up arguably *the* finest trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trail starts at a pretty trailhead along Highway 441, the main road through the park. The trail continues along the super scenic Alum Cave Creek; the trail is very well-maintained and easily hiked by younger children. The trail climbs through a unique geological feature you hike *through*, Arch Rock, then heads up more steeply toward Mt. LeConte. The trail then crosses an overlook surrounded by Mountain Laurel before climbing farther toward Alum Cave, yet another unique geological feature, Alum Cave, you hike *beneath.* It’s epic. This is a perfect spot for a rest and a picnic before returning to the trailhead. This is a challenging hike, and finding parking can also be a challenge, but it is worth the investment of time and effort, particularly for older kids or little kids looking for a big challenge.
