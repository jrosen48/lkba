        <Text>●	Stopping by the Ijams Visitor Center. Check out the Ijams River and Tower loop for an introduction to this other area of the Ijams Nature Center.
●	Playing at the Ijams Nature Playscape. An amazing and surprising part of Ijams, worthy of a visit on its own. Tucked away a bit on the side of the parking area at Mead’s Quarry. It’s a favorite for kids, with a treehouse, tightrope, stumps for jumping, and—yes—a mud pit!
●	Playing at the Ijams Primal playground. Also nearby, smaller than the Nature Playground, but packed with features for climbing and jumping.</Text>
