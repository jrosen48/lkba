        <Text>It is one of the closest hikes to the city center of Knoxville — and one of a few that is very stroller-friendly. This short but sweet hike is perfect as a real but accessible outing for toddlers and little kids. The red chairs at the top are a fun stopping point. The deep woods are pretty in the fall. This could be a great first hike for toddlers—it was one of the first for our little one, and we loved how accessible it was.
