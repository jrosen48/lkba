        <Text>●	Hanging out at Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery. Befitting the Obed Wild &amp; Scenic Area, the Lilly Pad Hopyard Brewery (https://www.lillypadhopyardbrewery.com) is a surprising, fantastic, kid-friendly destination. Stop by for food and drinks—only on Saturday and Sunday from 12-6 pm.
●	Playing around the bouldering area. The Trailhead features a nearby shaded area full of boulders. While we’ve often used this spot as a peaceful place to finish kiddo naps, older kids love trying to climb the boulders.</Text>
