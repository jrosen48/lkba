        <Text>●	Stopping at nearby restaurants and shops. Favorite nearby spots include the fantastic Wild Love Bakehouse (1625 N Central St, Knoxville, TN 37917), the quick, inexpensive, tasty Taqueria La Herradura (2625 N Broadway, Knoxville, TN 37917), and Hard Knox Pizza Central (2300 N Central St, Knoxville, TN 37917). 
●	Hiking further or on other trails. Sharp’s Ridge includes tons of other trails. A favorite starts at a different—but nearby—parking area, immediately behind the Cherry Creek Apartments (navigate to 3404 Dill St, Knoxville, TN 37917). We like the Lincoln Trail, which is an accessible mountain bike trail.</Text>
