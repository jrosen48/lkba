        <Text>●	Camping or renting a cabin at Pickett State Park. Pickett State Park, a nice campground that also has both historic and modern cabins to rent, is close to this trail. It also features a great lake for kayaking, canoeing, or paddle boarding.
●	View the night sky. Pickett State Park has a Silver-tier designation as an International Dark Sky Park. Even if you’re not strictly in the State Park, this is a great place to view stars and planets in the night sky.</Text>
