        <Text>Part of Norris Dam State Park, around thirty minutes north of Knoxville on the pretty Norris Lake.    This hike is one of the flattest we feature. Further, it's on a graded gravel path. Like the Knox-Blount Greenway along the Tennessee River, you may be surprised by the variety and quantity of wildlife you see along this scenic river, the Clinch. A relaxing trail for a family outing that might end with a drive over Norris Dam or a stop for a bite and a drink at the nearby Clinch River Brewery. This hike would be a fun challenge for the toddler ready to hike a bit farther.
