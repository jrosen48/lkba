        <Text>●	Camping at Bandy Creek! The Bandy Creek Campground is a gem - spacious sites, nice restrooms, and lots of cul-de-sacs for kids to endlessly play or bike. Consider a stay here as a launching point for this hike.
●	Visiting the horse stables. Kids will likely love the nearby stables that often house many horses —most from guests at the campground who will ride the trails that allow horses. There’s also the nearby Bandy Creek Loop trail, a good, short hike for young kiddos.
●	Stopping by the visitor’s center. A good place to learn more about the Big South Fork—and to ask any questions or to seek the advice of park rangers.</Text>
