        <Text>This is *the* wildflower hike in the Smokies. It’s a joy in mid-late April, depending on the year's weather. This hike starts on the kid-friendly Schoolhouse Gap trail and then connects to the Whiteoak Sink trail, which is a bit rockier but still hike-able by younger children. You may notice that Whiteoak Sink does not appear on the National Park Service trail map for the Smokies; technically, Whiteoak Sink is not an official trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the key takeaway for hikers is to respect this unique area of the park by staying on the trail and refraining to pick wildflowers. It is a must-hike during wildflower season, but also worth a trip outside of that elusive spring period. Because of the length, best for younger kids who are carried some or all of the way, or kids who are comfortable with a longer hike.
