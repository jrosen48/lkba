        <Text>●	Biking on the kids’ loop. The “green” mountain biking trail, Springarn, is a great spot for kids to begin to learn to ride on trails. It’s only 0.6 miles and is a nice complement to this hike.
●	Exploring some of the many other trails. William Hastie Natural Area features a ton of other trails. Consider taking Mitchie’s Way from near the parking area — and then looping back to Margaret Road and the start on the trail of your choice.</Text>
