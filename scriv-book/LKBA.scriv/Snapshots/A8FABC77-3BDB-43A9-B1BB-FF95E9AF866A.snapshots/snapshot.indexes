        <Text>Abrams Creek is a great place to start hiking in the Smokies if you live in or around Knoxville. It's accessible, offers a wide variety of features to please all members of the family, and has the added bonus of being beautiful! The enduring memory from this trail is of kids splashing endlessly in the shallow creeks. This was the first place we traveled as a family in the Smokies, and we returned again and again because we always enjoyed our time together there. There are many ways to shorten the hike, and we often hike around a mile in and then turn around. It can be warmer here in the summer months, but the river offers many opportunities to swim and splash around, making it a great destination for the summer as well. This hike is relatively challenging and better suited to hiking with older children, but the beauty of this hike is its versatility.
