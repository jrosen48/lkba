        <Text>Just far enough to be off the radar of many in Knoxville, this trail has a bit of everything - fun bridge crossings, deep forest, waterfalls, and two pretty overlooks. It does not climb so much as to become tiresome, but it's long enough to feel like a real adventure. There’s something about the Obed area that feels both wild and inviting. The only downside? It's a little out-of-the-way; in some ways, this trail feels farther than some destinations in the Smokies. It's worth it for a great family hike with kids of all ages. Though out of the way, there are a few fun things to do to extend the hike or to visit very nearby on the way home. Great for kids of all hiking ages, and not a bad hike on which to carry a little one.
