        <Text>This hike is great for families looking to have an authentic hiking experience deep in the Smokies while still being only a little over an hour's drive from Knoxville. A benefit of this hike is its distance–only 0.6 miles to the waterfall, but along a stream that affords many chances to hop in and splash. The turn-around spot is an overlook to a waterfall, Lynn Camp Prong, though the trail continues after the cascades up to another waterfall, Indian Flats Falls. Given the ample shade and easy access to the stream, this is a great hike for the summer, but it is enjoyable in all seasons. Good for kids of all ages.
