        <Text>This short hike leads to one of the most surprising geologic features in Tennessee—the Twin Arches, a 130-foot span and 100-foot height feature you can walk over, around, and through. The surrounding forest is not shabby, either. This is a fantastic and memorable family hike, with some challenges sprinkled in. First, this hike is the farthest (by driving distance) of any in this book. Second, there are some rocky sections that require some carefulness. Still, this is a must-see, and it's near many features (and places to camp) to make a visit more accommodating. Good for families with children of any walking age.
