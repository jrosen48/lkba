        <Text>●	Playing at one of the many playgrounds. There are four awesome playgrounds at Lakeshore — Hank Rappé (universal playground with a bit of everything), Huie Woodland (nature-themed), Tower (lots of climbing opportunities!), and Central (smaller, and with workout equipment nearby).
●	Having a picnic. Lakeshore seems made for picnics. Bring one along for a grassy area or numerous seating areas near the Hank Rappé, Tower, and Central playgrounds.
