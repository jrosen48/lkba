        <Text>Like a few of the other trails in or near the Cumberland Plateau, this is a spectacular hike that is a little off-the-radar of many in Knoxville. This is a spectacular hike that is a little tricky to get to for a day hike. Still, the view is awesome, rivaling the summits of the Smokies with a different kind of vantage — here, of the beautiful Big South Fork River. This trail is relatively flat and relatively short, making it appropriate for families with young children. Consider camping at the nearby Bandy Creek campground, and consider this hike a day's excursion from there.
