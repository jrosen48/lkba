        <Text>Writing about this trail makes us smile. In many ways, it's the perfect kid hike! It starts at a beautiful trailhead along a pretty creek in the deep woods. It gradually climbs before stopping at a scenic waterfall, DeBord Falls—one of two, and a perfectly acceptable place to turn around with younger kids (we have many times). It continues further to Emory Falls before returning on a gradual slope back to the trailhead. Stop at the playground you passed on the way to the trailhead beside the same creek; the water is usually shallow enough to be perfect for splashing and rock hopping. Best for kids comfortable with rocky trails.
