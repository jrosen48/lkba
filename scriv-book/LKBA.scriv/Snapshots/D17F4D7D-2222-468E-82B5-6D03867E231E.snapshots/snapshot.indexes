        <Text>●	Exploring the many other trails nearby. The trail we featured meanders through a very small section of a large, diverse park. The Nature Book Trail is a great trail to add on to your hike. There are many others; check out the map at the UT Arboretum website (https://utarboretum.tennessee.edu/) to learn more.
●	Stopping by Haw Ridge and its kids’ pump track. Nearby Haw Ridge Park features the Dirtlab Mountain Bike Skill Park, a great spot for kids riding strider and pedal bikes to hone their skills and build confidence.
