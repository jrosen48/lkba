        <Text>●	Visiting Kuwohi (Clingman's Dome). Nearby Kuwohi and the Kuwohi Trail to access this peak feature an observation tower with views in all directions. There’s also the nearby Kuwhohi Visitor Center. Both the trail and visitor center share the same parking area.
●	Stopping at Newfound Gap. On the way to Andrews Bald, you passed Newfound Gap—the mountain pass and scenic overlook atop the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. This is a good place to stop for photos or a brief (or lengthier!) hike on the Appalachian Trail that runs through the parking lot—and toward the popular scenic overlook Charlie’s Bunion, a steep, challenging eight-mile round-trip hike from Newfound Gap.</Text>
