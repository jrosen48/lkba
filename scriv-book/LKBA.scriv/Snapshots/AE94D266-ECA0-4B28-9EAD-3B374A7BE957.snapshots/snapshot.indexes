        <Text>●	Visiting the UT Gardens. The nearby UT Gardens (2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996) is a great spot for a meander through beautiful gardens. Be sure to check out the Children’s Garden featuring grassy moguls kids love to roll or hop down.
●	Biking the greenways. While we featured the Knox-Blount Greenway as a hike, it’s also a fun bike ride for young bikers.</Text>
