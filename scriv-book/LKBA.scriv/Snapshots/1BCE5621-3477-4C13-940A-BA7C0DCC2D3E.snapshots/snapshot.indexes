        <Text>●	Stopping by Bandy Creek. Check out the Bandy Creek chapter for more details. 
●	Hiking the Angel Falls Trail—and others. The Angel Falls Trail—not to be mistaken with the trail taken to the overlook featured in this hike—starts at the parking area beside the Leatherwood Ford Bridge. It follows the Big South Fork River to conclude with a different—closer—view of Angel Falls, but without the vista from the overlook. Also, the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area has more than 300 miles of trails.</Text>
