        <Text>Andrews Bald is the under-rated twin to Kuwohi (formerly known as Clingman's Dome). Kuwohi is the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park — the highest point in Tennessee and among the highest in the Eastern United States. Why Andrews Bald instead of Kuwohi? The path to Kuwohi is often exceptionally crowded. It is still worth a visit, but Andrews Bald is as or more exceptional in some ways: instead of reaching a crowded overlook, Andrews Bald is a grassy bald overlooking layers of mountains. Pair it with a trip to Kuwohi or a stop at Newfound Gap, perhaps catching sunset after an afternoon hike to Andrews Bald.  One memorable experience for us: we saw a bear on this trail, our first as a family. The hike has some rocky elements, and it can be lengthy, so we recommend this hike for older children.
