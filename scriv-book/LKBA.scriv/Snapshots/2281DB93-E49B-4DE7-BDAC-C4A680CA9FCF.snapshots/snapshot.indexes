        <Text>●	Visiting historic cabins. The nearby historic cabins are a must-see. Kids love to duck into and out of many recently restored (and others in the process of being restored).
●	Camping at Elkmont campground. The Elkmont Campground is scenic, large, and worth a visit, especially if you can reserve a spot beside the Little River.</Text>
