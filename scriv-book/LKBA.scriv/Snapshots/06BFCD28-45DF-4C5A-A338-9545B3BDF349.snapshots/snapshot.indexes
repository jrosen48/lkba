        <Text>Surprisingly close to Knoxville, given how remote and wild this trailhead and trail feels, Mouse Creek in the Big Creek area of the Smokies is quite a bit less well-known than many of the other trails in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in this book. The creek that this trail follows looks otherwordly - clear and almost turquoise in color. This hike starts at a trailhead at the Big Creek Picnic Area — beside the Big Creek Campground. The trail starts off a little steep, but the trail is wide and smooth; like the Middle Prong trail, this trail used to be a railroad bed. The trail follows above the creek and then returns closer to it, with Mouse Creek Falls as the turn-around. A good day-trip adventure for kids and families; the smooth grade makes this an achievable hike for younger littles.
