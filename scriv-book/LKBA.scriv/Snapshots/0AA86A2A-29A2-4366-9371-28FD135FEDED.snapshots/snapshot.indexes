        <Text>●	Visiting the Look Rock Overlook. Check the Look Rock Overlook hike for a short, nearby hike to a pretty overlook.
●	Camping at Abrams Creek Campground. This is a lovely creekside campground that you pass on this hike. Consider a stay in the summer, when jumping in the cool, not-too-deep creek can be a respite from the heat—or in the fall when this area pops with fall colors.
