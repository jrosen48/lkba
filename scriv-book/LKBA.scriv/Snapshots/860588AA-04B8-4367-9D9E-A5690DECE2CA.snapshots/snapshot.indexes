        <Text>Another hike that is very close to city center Knoxville, the Knox-Blount Greenway is a fun, easier outing for little walkers and for parents pushing little ones in strollers. Paved throughout, this trail offers a glimpse of the surprising beauty of the Tennessee River so close to the city. Our description features a route that heads to the north, toward the city, and then back to the trail from the research park further south before returning to the start; of course, you can hike any way you like! Look for blue herons and other birds along the side of the river; you might see a Bald Eagle! Limited shade makes this a great outing for clear but cold winter days but a hot hike during warmer, sunnier times. This will be a fun hike for a gaggle of kids looking to toddle or run wild!
