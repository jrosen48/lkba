        <Text>Steep but quiet and rewarding, Chestnut Top is a fun choice for a shorter hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This hike is one of the closest to Knoxville. Furthermore, it is close to the amenities of Townsend — a far quieter town than Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. The trail starts with a steep climb until it reaches a rocky point that is a great stopping point; we always grab a snack here, and kiddos like to hike on or around the rocks. The trail continues along the trail past pretty mountain laurel, typically in bloom around mid-May through early June, stopping at a fun but somewhat arbitrary point - a hollow tree! Continue farther if you like, or head back to the start and the Townsend Wye, a great picnic and water play spot. Best for kids who are comfortable with a steady climb.
