        <Text>●	Hiking at Mead’s Quarry. Check out the Ijams Crag hike for a great starting point at the over area that comprises Ijams.
●	Visit Jo’s Grove. Near the Visitor’s Center, which features a fun cabin and a wooded area for kids to play and goof (this is a premiere hide-and-seek spot!).
●	Grabbing a bite to eat on the south side of Knoxville. The south side of town near Ijams is a great place to grab a bite to eat. Our favorites include South Coast Pizza (1103 Sevier Ave, Knoxville, TN 37920) and Angry Dumplings Tea (1119 Sevier Ave, Knoxville, TN 37920). Breweries nearby also abound. </Text>
