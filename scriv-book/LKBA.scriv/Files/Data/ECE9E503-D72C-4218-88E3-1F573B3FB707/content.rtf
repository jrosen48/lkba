\f0\fs26 \cf0 The Cumberland Plateau is a wild place! In some ways (its remoteness and the fewer visitors most of its areas see), it feels more wild than the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We were surprised to learn that there even 
\f1\i is 
\f0\i0 a Cumberland Plateau - more or less to the west and north of Knoxville. It\'92s both a plateau and\'97particularly to the north\'97a mountainous region, especially Frozen Head State Park. Its defining characteristic is its geology: incredible rock features that result principally from fast-eroding sandstone. You\'92ll see rock formations large and (striking) large on all of your hikes in the plateau; some of these may amaze you that they are in East Tennessee. These hikes are some of the most special to us in this book; a little off-the-radar and even underappreciated, part of our motivation for writing this book was to draw attention to these hidden gems.}
